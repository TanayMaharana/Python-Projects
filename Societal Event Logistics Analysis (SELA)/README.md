## Problem Statement

The project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about the society's residents and flats. The goal is to analyze the data to better understand the residents, their flats, and their participation in the upcoming event. Additionally, there is a dataset of decorators and caterers information available. The objective is to empower the housing society committee to make informed decisions regarding event logistics, decoration, and catering services, aiming to optimize the event experience for residents while efficiently utilizing available resources.

## Objective

The primary objective is to analyze the data, enabling the housing society to make data-driven decisions, optimize event planning, and ensure the efficient utilization of resources. By leveraging decorator and caterer data, the goal is to enhance the event experience, minimize costs, and maximize resident satisfaction. The selection of the best caterer and decorator based on customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness plays a crucial role in achieving these goals and ensuring the success of the grand event.

## Insights From Analysis

### Demographic Observation:

- Both Wing A and B have a similar count of flats, but Wing A flats have a slightly bigger average flat area than Wing B. Due to that, Wing A has a higher average number of residents residing there than Wing B.
- In the whole housing society, most residents are from Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh. Most people are specifically from Maharashtra.

### Flat Information:

- Wing A has slightly more average flat area than Wing B flats.
- Most common number of rooms in the housing society is 2, indicating that most flats are 2bhk.
- The distribution of flat areas suggests that most flats lie between approximately 580-600 sq meters.

### Owner-Tenant Observation:

- In the housing society, the number of owned flats is more than the number of flats on rent.
- Owner - Tenant Origin wise: Out of the top 5 cities in the housing society, both owners and tenants are mainly from Maharashtra. Most Owners are from [Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Haryana, Bangalore], while most Tenants are from [Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat].
- Owner - Tenant Wing wise: In Wing A, the number of owned flats is more than the number of flats on rent. In Wing B, the number of flats on rent is more than the number of owned flats. Overall, in the housing society, more flats are owned than on rent.

### Event Planning Recommendation:

- The total amount of donation is higher from Owners than Tenants, indicating that the number of owners is more than tenants.
- The average of donations is higher from tenants, likely due to the smaller number of tenants compared to owners.

- Recommendations:
  - Budget allocation may be optimized based on donations.
  - Expect a good turnout for the event.

### Decorator Analysis Recommendation:

- The highest-rated decorator is 'p' with a rating of 4.8.
- The most cost-effective caterer is 'g' with a plate cost of 250.
